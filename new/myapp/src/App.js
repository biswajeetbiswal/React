          <h2>Surgery</h2>
          <p>
            Veterinary surgery is surgery performed on animals by veterinarians,
            whereby the procedures fall into three broad categories:
            orthopaedics (bones, joints, muscles), soft tissue surgery (skin,
            body cavities, cardiovascular system.

          <h2>Vacciantions</h2>
          <p>
            Vaccinating animals helps in stimulating an immune response without
            causing the disease itself. This creates early exposure to
            disease-causing organisms, where the animals' immune system is able
            to recall the infectious agent to which the animal is vaccinated.

          <h2>wellness exams</h2>
          <p>
            During a routine wellness examination, your veterinarian will ask
            you questions about your dog's diet, exercise, how much they're
            drinking, breathing, behavior, habits, elimination patterns (i.e.,
            bowel movements and urination), lifestyle, and general health.
